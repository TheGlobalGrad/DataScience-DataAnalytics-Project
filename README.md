## 📊 Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This is a Data Science and Python project where I analyzed a dataset of Netflix movies using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

### 📁 Dataset

* **File**: `Netflix_mymoviedb.csv`
* Contains information on movies like:
      * Title
      * Genre
      * Release Date
      * Popularity
      * Vote Average
      * and more...

### 📌 Key Objectives

* Load and clean the dataset
* Convert object types (e.g., dates) to appropriate formats
* Extract insights such as:
        * Most popular movies
        * Year-wise movie trends
        * Distribution of genres
        * Top-rated movies
* Use visualizations to support analysis

### 🧠 Skills Used

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Data Cleaning (`.dropna`, `.astype`, `pd.to_datetime`)
* Feature Engineering (`.dt.year` to extract year)
* Data Visualization using:
      * `matplotlib.pyplot`
      * `seaborn`
* Boolean filtering (e.g., `df['Popularity'] == df['Popularity'].max()`)

### 📷 Sample Visualizations

* Bar plots of genre distribution
* Line plots of movies released per year
* Count plots for rating distribution

### 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have Jupyter and the required Python libraries installed
3. Open `Data_Science_Project.ipynb` and run all cells
